# SLOTSPROJECT
This project was a simple PYTHON project in which you refresh your browser. Each time youreset your browser you get six sets of different numbres ranging from 0-3, and you get different text options dependin on how manny of those number match up. I learned  how to get data from a function using return keyword,and I also learned about making decisions based on two or more factors.
