# SLOTSPROJECT
This project was a simple PYTHON project in which you refresh your browser for different chances at winning big. Each time you refresh your browser you get six sets of numbers ranging from 0-3 and you get different text options depending on how many of those numbers match up. I learned how to get data from a function using return keyword and I also learned about making decisions based on two or more factors.
